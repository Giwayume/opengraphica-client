- Fundamental photo editing tools like those found in GIMP or Photoshop
- Vector graphic and text editing
- 2D and 3D transforms; fully 3D render environment
- Keyframe-based timeline animations
- Side-by-side artboard display for comparison or scratch work
- Basic programming hooks for creating interactions in a "viewer" mode
